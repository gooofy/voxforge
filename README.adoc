Zamia AI
========

The Zamia AI project is a framework that provides a set of components needed to
build completely free, open source end-to-end speech and natural language 
processing A.I.  systems.

For more information about the Zamia AI project check out our homepage at:

Getting Started
---------------

Try Our Example Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to see Zamia AI in action is to download one of our precompiled examples:

http://goofy.zamia.org/zamia-ai/

Chatbot
^^^^^^^

This is a simple text chat bot built on top of Zamia AI's knowledge base. You can chat with the model by
running the command:

```
zaicli chat
```

Here is a sample session giving you some ideas to get your conversation started:

```
[bofh@centos7 chatbot]$ zaicli chat
...
ai> okay computer
INFO:root:RESP: [   0.5] Greetings! | action: attention(on)
ai> what is your name
INFO:root:RESP: [   0.5] My name is "HAL 9000" 
ai> who was the predecessor of barack obama
INFO:root:RESP: [   0.2] The predecessor of "Barack Obama" as "President of the United States of America" was "George W. Bush". 
ai> what time is it
INFO:root:RESP: [   0.1] It is 6 minutes past 0 
ai> are you a computer
INFO:root:RESP: [   0.1] Yes, I am a Computer. Are you knowledgeable about Computers? 
ai> what is your favorite movie
INFO:root:RESP: [   1.0] 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick 
ai> 
```

You can also run the chatbot application itself which shoud also give you a starting point on how
to embed Zamia AI into you own applications:

```
./chatbot.py
```

Voice Assistant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example show how Zamia AI can be combined with Zamia Speech Kaldi ASR Models and eSpeak NG
to create a completely free, offline capable voice assistant.

Compiling Zamia AI Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the chatbot example that comes with Zamia AI. You can also find it online here:

https://github.com/gooofy/zamia-ai/tree/master/examples/chatbot

to try it, create a directory and put all the source files there. 

Now, the first step is to compile the skills that are used in this examples - i.e. Zamia AI will
will compute all sample utterances plus their corresponding responses from the skills our `toplevel.py`
skill depends on into an SQLite DB. To do this, we run the command

```
zaicli compile all
```

you can check out the number of utterances extracted from each skill using the command

```
zaicli stats
```

also, you can check the utterances extracted from all or specific skills using the command

```
zaicli utterances [-s skill]
```

Train word vectors using fastText:

```
wget 'http://goofy.zamia.org/zamia-speech/misc/sentences-en.txt.xz'
unxz sentences-en.txt.xz

zaicli utterances >utts.txt

cat utts.txt sentences-en.txt > corpus.txt
mkdir model
fasttext skipgram -input corpus.txt -output model/word_embeddings
```

Once we are satisfied it is time to train our NLP model which will allow Zamia AI to handle utterances
that have no exact match in our DB:

```
zaicli train
```

Utterance Classification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Utterance classification is used to predict which of the existing skills a new utterance fits best. Can also be 
used on a text file containing one utterance per line.

Train the classifier:
```
zaicli utt_class_train
```

Run the prediction:
```
zaicli utt_class "Who is the current US President?"
```

Adapt the Kaldi Speech Recognition Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: This is only needed for application that use voice input.

```
cat utts.txt utts.txt utts.txt utts.txt utts.txt sentences-en.txt >corpus5.txt

MODEL="/opt/kaldi/model/kaldi-generic-en-tdnn_sp"

cut -f 1 -d ' ' ${MODEL}/data/local/dict/lexicon.txt >vocab.txt
lmplz -o 4 --prune 0 1 2 3 --limit_vocab_file vocab.txt --interpolate_unigrams 0 <corpus5.txt >lm.arpa

rm -rf work
kaldi-adapt-lm ${MODEL} lm.arpa en-tdnn_sp
tar xfJ work/kaldi-en-tdnn_sp-adapt.tar.xz
```
